## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/alexnodeland/resume-crew.git
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes:

git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```


### 4. Make Your Changes

Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and passes all tests.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Use semantic commit messages to describe your changes. Here are some common types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Example:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: add job posting analysis feature"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```sh
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the main repository. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description of your changes.

## Best Practices

- **Write clear, concise commit messages**: Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- **Keep pull requests small**: Focus on one change per pull request.
- **Write tests**: Ensure your code is well-tested.
- **Follow the coding standards**: Maintain consistency in the codebase.

Thank you for your contributions!
